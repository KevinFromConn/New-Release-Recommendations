# New Music Reccommendations (Group Project One)

The goal of this project is to create a functioning application using at least two server-side APIs. Our group chose to create an application which will recommend to the user new music based on their search of genre. The API used is the Spotify API. Users will be able to search for a genre (shown on screen as "Music that fits your style") and be shown the top three results for new releases in that genre. In a future update, we plan on also showing the user the top three music-related news stories upon loading the page.

# Disclaimer

The authorization code given for the Spotify API only works for an hour at a time, so when the TAs look at our live application to grade the project, it may not work as intended. A potential workaround for this would be to create a new authorization code for the purposes of making the API functional for grading.
